# OverflowMe
Put simply, it's a Google Chrome extension that searches StackOverflow.

Do you find yourself spending countless keystrokes searching StackOverflow for code help, creating a non-DRY search process that takes tons of time from your super productive day? Never fear, OverflowMe is here! 

Search StackOverflow right from your browser with this <a href="http://bit.ly/1y7hIWS">Google Chrome extension</a> goodness. To use, simply type "so" (no quotes, of course) in your address bar, hit TAB, then enter your search terms. Hit the "enter" key and you're on your way! 

It's commented so that you can easily change the search terms, keyword, and target URL for use in your own projects. Feel free to contribute stuff or give me feedback!
